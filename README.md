# MNIST_CNN

## Introduction

This project purpose is to test different hyperparameters in a convolutional neural network for the MNIST dataset and to observe how they perform during training and testing on images from the test set.

## Project Components

This project contains the following components:
* MNIST_Hyperparameter_Testing.ipynb file - Contains training and saving the models with the tested hyperparameters.
* MNIST_TrainedModels_Experiments.ipynb file - Contains loading and testing each model on 10 random images from the test set.
* Trained Models - Contains 16 .pt files of the saved models that can be loaded and used for observing their performance on the test set.

This repository also contains LaTeX documentation of the project and observations made on the saved models, available both in .pdf and .tex formats.

## Technologies used

* PyTorch.
* Matplotlib.
