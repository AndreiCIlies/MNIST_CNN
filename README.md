# MNIST_CNN

## Introduction

This project purpose is to test different hyperparameters in a convolutional neural network for the MNIST dataset and to observe how they perform during training and testing on images from the test set.

## Project Components

This project contains the following components:
* MNIST_Hyperparameter_Testing.ipynb file - Contains training and saving the models with the tested hyperparameters.
* MNIST_TrainedModels_Experiments.ipynb - Contains loading and testing each model on 10 random images from the test set.
* Trained Models - Contains 16 .pt files with the trained models that can be loaded and used for observing their performance on the test set.

## Technologies used

* PyTorch.
* Matplotlib.
